# UdacityStudentEngagement
Analyzing engagement data among Udacity students

Looked at factors such as days spent learning, lessons attended, and minutes spent to determine best predictors of passing projects.

Did the entire data analysis process: 
1. Cleaning / wrangling / tracking down problems/outliers throughout
2. Refining the research question
3. Exploring the data, finding patterns & building intuition
4. Drawing conclusions
5. Communicating the data through data visualization
